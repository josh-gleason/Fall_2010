\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this paper is to propose a new design for a casino style video slot machine and
attempt to resolve possible implementation issues.  The payback rate for the slot machine must
be approximately 85\%.  This means that for every \$1.00 that a patron inserts into the machine,
approximately \$0.85 will be returned.

\subsection{Type of Machine}

  The video slot machine industy has many types of slot machines, of these, three different
categories will be considered.  The first type would be one that uses playing cards.  This type
of machine uses a virtual deck to determine the card values, and then depending on some set of
rules may pay back an amount based on the card types and/or values.  Another type of video slot
considered here is the reel type slot machine.  These slot machines can consist of either
physical or virtual reels with various symbols on them.  When these types of slots are played
the reels spin for some random amount of time and then stop.  The payout is then somehow
determined by the symbols that are visible on these reels.  The last category to be considered
is the games where the player makes some sort of choice, and then lets the game continue until
the round is complete.  If the player choose correctly then a payout is rewarded.
